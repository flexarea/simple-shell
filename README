Functionality:
Input redirection: ./program < input-file
Open input-file, use dup to set fd stdin to input-file, exec program, reprompt

Output redirection: ./program > output-file (append) or ./program >> output-file (truc)
Open output file (append or trunc), use dup to set fd stdout to output file, exec program, reprompt

 ./program1 | ./program2
Fork for both programs?, set up a pipe (man 2 pipe?) between them, exec both programs, reprompt

Test Files:
test_in.c: contains a simple program that reads a line from stdin
- f_in.txt: file containing a line to be read by test_in
test_out.c: Writes a string to stdout
- f_out.txt: file that should be written to

Makefile:
"make all" to make all c files into executibles. (implemented horrifically I know)
"make clean" to remove all executibles.
"make file.c" to make a specific file.
