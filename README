Grayson And Esdras

Functionality:
Input redirection: ./program < input-file
Open input-file, use dup to set fd stdin to input-file, exec program, reprompt

Output redirection: ./program > output-file (append) or ./program >> output-file (truc)
Open output file (append or trunc), use dup to set fd stdout to output file, exec program, reprompt

 ./program1 | ./program2
Fork for both programs, set up a pipe (man 2 pipe?) between them, exec both programs, reprompt
